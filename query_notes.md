# SQL Queries Notes

### SELECT Statements
Used to read data from one or more tables.

### JOINS
- **INNER JOIN**: Returns matching rows from both tables.
- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table, even if there's no match in the right.

### Subqueries
- Can be used in `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE` clauses.
- Helps break down complex queries.

### Aggregations
- Use functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`
- Combine with `GROUP BY` to summarize data
